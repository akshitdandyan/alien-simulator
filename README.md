## Task 04: Creatures

### My thought process for this Task

This task was actually pretty simple and quick. I just had to add a new species (predators) and create two concrete types for them. Then I used the Factory Method pattern to build both aliens and predators in a clean way. Since there was no interaction between the two groups yet, keeping them separate made the design easy to manage. The UML was also straightforward to update.
