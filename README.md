## Task 02: Alien Simulator – Extension

### My thought process for this Task

I started by just trying to understand what the task was really asking. At first it looked simple — just aliens and display methods — but then I realized the key was in how behaviors like visitEarth() could change later. That’s when I thought of using the Strategy pattern.

I made a few mistakes with the arrow types and forgot some UML rules, but fixing them helped me understand how each part connects. I also tried to keep things clean and not overcomplicate. This helped me see patterns more clearly and stick to only what’s needed for each step.
