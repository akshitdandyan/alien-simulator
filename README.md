## Task 05: UFOs

### My thought process for this Task

At first, I was a bit confused by the term “abstract factory.” I thought it was just a regular factory with abstract methods or something. But then I realized it’s called that because it creates related groups of objects — like a whole UFO setup depending on whether it’s for aliens or predators.

I had to map which factory creates which UFO, and what each UFO should contain. The only tricky part was deciding whether to show internal components (like drives and weapons) in the UML, but I kept it simple there and added more logic inside the code. Also, the diagram was getting big, so I made it a separate one and linked to the earlier one.

Overall, once I understood the pattern, it was pretty fun to implement.
